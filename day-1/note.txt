Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types.
 Explain with some examples.
ans: A data type is an attribute that specifies the type of data that a variable can hold. 
It determines what kind of operations can be performed on that data and how much memory it will take up. In programming,
 data types help define the nature of the data (whether it's an integer, 
a floating-point number, a character, a string, etc.) and how the system will treat it.

There are two main categories of data types:

Primitive Data Types:
Integer (int):
Floating Point (float, double):
Character (char)
Boolean (bool):
String 
Non-Primitive Data Types:
Array:
List (or other similar collections):
Class/Objects:
